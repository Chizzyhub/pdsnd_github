### Date created
This project was created on the 5th of June 2020.

### Project Title
US bikeshare data project

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
This project contains the bike share data for Chicago, New York City and Washington in CSV format along with the bikeshare.py script
